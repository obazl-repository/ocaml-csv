= OCaml CSV (Bazel-enabled)

link:README.original.md[Original README]

WARNING: 2/8/23 Probably won't work atm - the `rules_ocaml` repo needs to be
updated, which should happen in the next day or so.

== Quickstart

* Run all tests:

    bazel test tests

* Build all targets:

    bazel build //...

* Build `csvtool`:

    bazel build csvtool:csvtool.exe

* Build library:

    bazel build src:csv

== Toolchains

By default the compiler used is `ocamlopt.opt`. To use a different
compiler, pass it using `--config=<compiler>`. For example, to run the
tests using `ocamlc.byte`:

    bazel test tests --config=ocamlc.byte


NOTE: Executables used as "tools" are always built with
`ocamlopt.opt`. For example, `//config:pp.exe` is a tool dependency of
`//csvtool:\__test-utf8.output__`, so it is built with `ocamlopt.opt`.
